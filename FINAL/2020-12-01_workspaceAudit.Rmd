# Workspace Audit

You should place this file in your github local path for this course, in a subfolder called "final" ... for me that is `C:/_git_/WSU_STATS419_FALL2020/final/`;


## Set your WSU id and location of your github USERNAME/REPO
```{r}
wsu.id = "kathleen rivas"; # change this to yours.
github.repository = "kat-rivas/WSU_STATS419_FALL2020";
# be sure to change the notebook title at the top of this document to be "you" based on your wsu.id
```

### Code Frequency on GitHub
Browse to <https://github.com/MonteShaffer/WSU_STATS419_FALL2020/graphs/code-frequency> where you replace my repository name with yours.  Screenshot and include the graphic in this folder, named "github-code-frequency.png".

### Commit Frequency on GitHub
Browse to <https://github.com/MonteShaffer/WSU_STATS419_FALL2020/graphs/commit-activity> where you replace my repository name with yours.  Screenshot and include the graphic in this folder, named "github-commits.png".

## General Workspace Environment Data
```{r}
path.to.git.local = "C:/_git_/WSU_STATS419_FALL2020/";
setwd(path.to.git.local);

path.to.git.final = paste0(path.to.git.local,"FINAL/");
```

## General Workspace Environment Data
```{r}
my.object = list();

sg = Sys.getenv();
  snames = names(sg); 
  svals = as.character(sg);
sgdf = as.data.frame(cbind(snames,svals));

my.object$environment = sgdf;

```

## Local Computer Setup

### Dropbox
Using your file-explorer, browse to your "Dropbox" folder on your computer, enter the "__student_access__" folder for this course, and take a screenshot.  Place in this folder "final/dropbox.png" ...

<IMG src='dropbox.png' style="border: 2px black solid;" />
<div>**Source: LOCAL COMPUTER**</div>

### Git tool

Take a screenshot of your gitbash tool (or if you use Github Desktop, that will do).  Be certain the screenshot is referencing your repository for this course. Place in this folder "final/git.png" ...

### Git History

Open your git tool from the command line and browse to the correct folder ...  Type `git status` to verify you are in the right place.

Now type: `git log --shortstat --pretty=format:'%h|%t|%p|%ai|%ae|%an|%ci|%ce|%cn|%N|%f|%s|%b' | paste - - - > final/git-history.log` which will create a file with your git history as a text file.  We will import and perform a basic graph.


```{r}
#  git log --shortstat --pretty=format:'"%h","%an","%ae","%aD","%s",' | paste - - - > final/git-history.log
# git log --oneline --decorate > final/git-history.log
# git log --shortstat --pretty=format:'%h|%t|%p|%ai|%ae|%an|%ci|%ce|%cn|%N|%f|%s|%b' > final/git-history.log

## Conclusive Summary

```{r}
# you need to upload the .rds and .html file after you KNIT ...
saveRDS(my.object, paste0(path.to.git.final,"workspaceAudit.rds") );
```

This audit is worth 50 points.  Based on your activity in the workspace, self-assess how many points you merit.  Mastery is perfection at 50 points; Developing is about 40 points; Nascent is about 30 points.  Justify your decision based on the consistency of your use of the tools and workspace throughout the semester.

Be certain to review the graphs and include self-reflective commentary on your work habits: day of week, hour of day, and so on.

<pre style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #717171; border: 2px solid #981e32;">
-- WRITE SOMETHING HERE --

I deserve 35/50 points because I believe that the workspace requirement wasn't adequately explained to the class as being worth 50 points.  Technically, I am Nascent at 30 points, but that is a D and failing, and since the instructions weren't clear, I should at least minimum pass this requirement at a C.  I used the workspace when needed to function (i.e. project measure), which I personally found frustrating because I kept having to commit and push my corrections.  I can't remember why I needed to do that, when I didn't need to do that for the midterm, but I did.  Maybe to do with my custom functions working as they were being pulled from Git.  I don't quite remember.  Therefore, I think my work habits are grade-driven, with an outline of what is expected of me.  I am not one of those rare self-driven to learn types (of which, ironically, my husband and best friend are, both male.  Are males more self-driven to learn (in general than females)? From my experience they are rare regardless of gender, but I can't remember any female I've come across that were of this rare type.)  I've met professors who are also self-driven (for example, my community college Calculus 2 professor is another on of those self-driven to learn).  

Not trying to ding on females.  I've known some very smart women, and one was the smartest in math that I've ever come across in my age group (not counting people 10+ years older than me).  But she wasn't "self-driven" with an almost relentless curiosity that I associate with self-driven people.

Because the workspace audit, nor the notebooks were explicity outlined as being graded, I fell short of Developing/Mastery level.  

----

so as I am going through the audit, I want to note I don't have a Dropbox image because I didn't sign up for Dropbox. One, it wasn't stated that I had to do that.  And two, I didn't mind checking your Dropbox manually.  I used to have Dropbox, and unsubscribed about a year or two ago because of lack of use.  I try to limit how much things I'm subscribed to (and still am subscribed to a dismaying amount).  Plus...wasn't explicitly stated as a requirement...

Also, the graphs are a little confusing to me at this time, with very little time to spare.  But I think they are a bit misleading?  I don't gradually decrease usage over the days and weeks.  It's either I'm committing for an upcoming assignment...or...I'm not.  However, the hours in the day plots were funny.  Very true.  I start school after I feed the youngest his breakfast, generally get going at around 8AM, work off and on throughout the day, depending on my school workload for the week, and activity spikes up after 8 to 8:30pm (which is the kids bedtime). I SHOULD go to sleep at 11pm for health and productivity reasons, but half the nights I will get caught up with something and stay up until around midnight.  If you'll notice, activity is nonexistent during night, or during mealtimes. But otherwise, I'm always "on" in some form or fashion.
